You! You there! Please, come over here!
I'm sure you've noticed it when the world became monochromatic.
There was an evil wizard that tried to take over the kingdom by stealing the Primary Prism and splitting the world into 3: Red, Blue, and Yellow.
I was able to defeat him but was gravely injured in the process and fear I won't be able to make it back to the tower to replace the Prism.
Please, take it. Return it to its rightful place and restore the world to how it was before.
With it, you'll be able to switch between spectrums as well as fire motes of color.
As you switch between the spectrums, you'll find that new paths will open; but with new paths come new enemies.
Be on the lookout for the wizard's minions that are still around and either destroy them with the motes or dodge them by swapping to a new color.
Please return the Prism to the tower for me. I wish you luck.
